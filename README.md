# SMS SPAM DETECTION

SMS Spam Detection
SMS spam is a type of unsolicited commercial message that is sent to mobile phones. It can be used to promote products or services, or to spread malware or phishing links. SMS spam can be a nuisance, and it can also be dangerous.

This repository contains a machine learning model that can be used to detect SMS spam. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled SMS messages, and it can be used to predict whether a new SMS message is spam or not spam.
